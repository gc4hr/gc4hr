        <h1>Atena Farghadani, age 28</h1>
        <h4>Artist, Iran</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Atena Farghadani is an Iranian artist and political activist, who is currently imprisoned. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience.
          In her cartoon, in which she criticized a draft law which would outlaw voluntary sterilisation restrict access to measures of birth control, she portrayed Iranian government officials as monkeys and goats. After publishing her artworks on Facebook, she was arrested in August 2014 and jailed for three months in Evin Prison in Tehran on charges of spreading propaganda, insulting members of parliament, and insulting the Supreme Leader of Iran. She was released in November.</p>
